i thought about adding Log instead of System.err but not necessary 
command line point input to pass parameters dynamically during execution allowing for dynamic input managementand enables different behaviours of the same program based on the provided arguements 
so in short the advantages :
1- Dynamic input make programs more versatile and adaptable to different scenarios. without changint the source code 
2- Autmoation and scripting: command line arguments are often used in scripts and automation tasks, allowing users to run programs with specific parameters without manual intervention.
3- Allow different configs and behavs based on user-specififed values
